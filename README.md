# A practical approach using inertial sensors (MPU-6050) applied to 3D motion tracking

Here, we will to introduce a pratical approach, which will use an inertial sensor with six degrees of freedom (MPU-6050) physically represented by a dice, whose demonstration of its motion will be displayed in the Blender that is an application widely used in 3D animations. 

The sensor is coupled to a Raspberry PI device, where was possible to explore the communication of the sensor with Blender and Processing through a wireless network in the IEEE 802.11 standard using the UDP client/server protocol. In both sides we used the Python programming language supported by Rasbian operating system and by Blender Game Engine module. 

In this way, we hope to add some contribution towards to demystifying the use of this type of sensor to applications associated with Blender and Processing. But, there applications in other areas, such as robotic, entertainment, automobilistic and aero-spatial industries, etc.
